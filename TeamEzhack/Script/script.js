Yomari is a traditional Nepali sweet dumpling made from steamed dough and typically filled with a mixture of jaggery and sesame seeds. It's a delicacy often prepared during festivals like Yomari Punhi. Here's a recipe along with a description:

Yomari Recipe
Ingredients:
For the Dough:

1 cup rice flour
1/2 cup water (or as needed)
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
For the Filling:

1/2 cup jaggery (finely chopped or grated)
1/4 cup sesame seeds (toasted)
1/4 cup grated coconut (optional)
1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder (optional)</p>

<h3>Instruction</h3>
<p>Prepare the Dough:

In a mixing bowl, combine the rice flour, sugar, and salt.
Gradually add water to the mixture, kneading continuously until you get a smooth, soft dough. The consistency should be similar to playdough. Cover the dough with a damp cloth to keep it from drying out.
<br /><br />Prepare the Filling:

In a pan over low heat, melt the jaggery, stirring frequently until it becomes a smooth syrup. If youâ€™re using grated jaggery, it will melt quickly.
Add the toasted sesame seeds to the jaggery syrup. If you're using grated coconut and cardamom powder, add them as well. Mix thoroughly and let it cool.
<br /><br />Shape the Yomari:

Take a small portion of the dough and flatten it into a small disc, about 3-4 inches in diameter.
Place a spoonful of the jaggery filling in the center of the disc.
Gently fold the edges of the dough over the filling to form a dumpling, pinching the edges to seal them tightly. The shape should resemble a teardrop or a small pouch.
<br /><br />Steam the Yomari:

Prepare a steamer by boiling water in the base.
Place the yomari on a steaming rack lined with parchment paper or banana leaves to prevent sticking.
Steam the yomari for about 15-20 minutes or until the dough is cooked through and slightly translucent.
<br /><br />Serve:

Allow the yomari to cool slightly before serving. They can be enjoyed warm or at room temperature.</p>`;

    <h2>Dhirki</h2>
    <p>Dhirki  is a traditional Nepali dish made from buckwheat or millet flour.
     It's a staple food in many parts of Nepal and is known for its simplicity and nutritious qualities. </p>
     <h3>Ingridient</h3>
     <p>1 cup buckwheat flour (or millet flour, if preferred)
1 1/2 cups water (or as needed)
1/2 teaspoon salt (optional)</p>
<h3>Instruction</h3>
<p>Prepare the Mixture:

In a medium-sized pot, heat 1 1/2 cups of water until it begins to boil. If you're using salt, you can add it to the water.
Gradually add the buckwheat flour to the boiling water while stirring continuously to avoid lumps. You can use a whisk or a wooden spoon.
<br /><br />Cook the Mixture:

Reduce the heat to low and continue to cook the mixture, stirring frequently. The mixture will start to thicken and become smooth.
Cook for about 10-15 minutes, stirring regularly, until the mixture becomes a thick, cohesive dough and starts to pull away from the sides of the pot.
<br /><br />Shape and Serve:

Once the dhirki is cooked, transfer it to a plate or a traditional dhido-making vessel. Let it cool slightly before shaping.
Use a wooden spatula or spoon to shape the dhirki into small portions or traditional shapes. It can be served with a variety of accompaniments like vegetable curry, pickles, or yogurt.</p>`;

    <p>Selroti is a traditional Nepali ring-shaped, deep-fried bread made from rice flour.
     It's slightly sweet, with a crispy exterior and a soft, fluffy interior. 
     Selroti is often prepared during festivals, special occasions, and religious ceremonies in Nepal.
     It's usually served with yogurt, curry, or just enjoyed on its own as a snack.</p>
     <h3>Ingrident</h3>
     <p>2 cups of rice flour (preferably freshly ground)
1/2 cup of sugar (adjust to taste)
1/4 cup of ghee or butter (melted)
1/2 cup of milk (optional, for richer texture)
1/2 teaspoon of ground cardamom (optional, for flavor)
1/2 teaspoon of ground fennel seeds (optional, for flavor)
1/4 teaspoon of baking soda (optional, for fluffiness)
1 ripe banana (mashed, optional, for softness)
Water (as needed, to make the batter)
Oil or ghee for deep frying</p>
<h3>Instruction</h3>
<p>Preparing the Batter:
In a large mixing bowl, combine the rice flour, sugar, ground cardamom, ground fennel seeds, and baking soda (if using).
Add the mashed banana to the mixture and mix well.
Gradually add melted ghee or butter, milk (if using), and water to the flour mixture, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. The batter should be smooth and slightly thick, with a consistency similar to pancake batter.
Cover the batter and let it rest for 2-3 hours. This resting time allows the flavors to develop and the batter to thicken slightly.
<br/><br/>Frying the Selroti:
Heat oil or ghee in a deep frying pan or wok over medium heat. The oil should be hot but not smoking.
Once the oil is hot, pour the batter into a piping bag or a clean plastic bag with a small hole cut in one corner (you can also use your hands if you're comfortable).
Carefully pipe or pour the batter into the hot oil in a circular motion to form a ring shape (similar to a doughnut).
Fry the Selroti until it turns golden brown on one side, then carefully flip it to cook the other side. Each Selroti should take about 2-3 minutes per side.
Once both sides are golden brown and crispy, remove the Selroti from the oil and place it on a paper towel to drain excess oil.</p>`;

    <h2>Lopsi</h2>
    <p>Lapsi, also known as Nepali hog plum, is a small, sour fruit native to Nepal.
     It's often used to make a traditional candy or pickle. The candy, known as "Lapsi Candy" or "Lapsiko Titaura," 
    is sweet, tangy, and slightly spicy. It's a popular treat in Nepal and enjoyed by people of all ages.</p>
    <h3>Ingredient</h3>
    <p>500 grams of Lapsi (Nepali hog plum)
300 grams of sugar
1/2 teaspoon of red chili powder (optional, for a spicy kick)
1/4 teaspoon of salt
1/4 teaspoon of black salt (optional, for extra tanginess)
1/2 teaspoon of cumin powder
1/2 teaspoon of ginger powder (optional)
1/2 teaspoon of turmeric powder</p>
<h3>Instruction</h3>
<p>Preparing the Lapsi:
Wash the Lapsi thoroughly under running water.
Boil the Lapsi in a large pot with enough water to cover the fruits. Boil until the Lapsi becomes soft and the skin starts to peel off (about 15-20 minutes).
Drain the water and let the Lapsi cool. Once cool, peel the skin off the fruits and remove the seeds. You should be left with the soft, pulpy flesh of the Lapsi.
<br/><br/>Making the Lapsi Candy:
In a large pan, add the Lapsi pulp and sugar. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly.
As the sugar dissolves, the mixture will start to thicken. Keep stirring to prevent the mixture from sticking to the pan.
Add the salt, black salt (if using), cumin powder, ginger powder (if using), red chili powder, and turmeric powder. Mix well to combine all the spices.
Continue to cook until the mixture becomes thick and sticky. The consistency should be like a thick jam or paste.
Remove the pan from the heat and let the mixture cool slightly.
Shaping the Candy:
Once the mixture is cool enough to handle, take small portions and shape them into small balls, discs, or any desired shape.
Spread the shaped candies on a tray lined with parchment paper. Let them cool completely.
Once cooled, the candies will firm up and can be stored in an airtight container.</p>
